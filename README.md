# 🚗 Car Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the selling price of a car using linear regression. By analyzing key features such as mileage, car model, and age, the model helps estimate the resale value of a vehicle, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## 📌 Project Objectives

Predict the resale price of a car based on its attributes.

Understand how factors like mileage and age impact car value.

Apply linear regression to build a predictive model.

Visualize relationships between variables and the predicted price.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

Feature	Description :
Car Model  :	The make/model of the car (e.g., Toyota Corolla)
Mileage :	Distance driven (in km or miles)
Age (yrs) : 	Age of the car in years
Sell Price ($)	:  Target variable – resale price of the car
